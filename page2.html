 Pairs is a beautiful city but there are many cons as well as pros. I recently got to visit Paris and those three days I was there I instantly fell in love. As much as i love paris I would never live there for multiple reasons, One of the biggest reasons I wouldn't live there is because it very expensive!! Paris been name to the seventh most expensive city in the world. If you want to go eat breakfast with your family its most likely to cost you more than 40 to 50 dollars, Clothes are more pricer, alcohol will cost you 10 dollars. Another reason as to why i wouldn't live in Paris is because There not that many attraction compared to LA. Yea Paris has Disneyland but that just about it, La has Knotts berry farm, six flag, California adventure,Universal studios, and sea world. Lastly, If your someone who loves the beach Paris isn't for you even if there was a beach the weather in Paris is very cold so you'll be freezing most of the time.
