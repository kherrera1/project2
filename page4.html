<h1> Hey my name Katherine Herrera and I live in LA. Ive been living here for all my life which would be 15 years. Ive recently got a chance of lifetime to go Paris.I stayed in Paris for a whole week and I loved the architecture of all the building and the food.LA in the other hand will forever have my heart living in LA has taught me a lot. One of the biggest things its taught me is to be grateful for your surrounding. I live in Hawthorne, If i ever feel like going to the becah its would be like a 10 min drive, if i want to go to a concert it would be a 10 min drive to the forum or any small venue, if i want to go to Disneyland or knotts i can take the freeway and ill get there less than an hour. If thats what your really into then LA is for you.</h1>
